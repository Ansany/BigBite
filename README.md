I almost done with this app, I'm going to create a presentation of this app at this read me file, when I will finish. 
But you also can read files, and watch a code.

A bit info about the app:
 - Now all the images of dishes saved inside the project (leter i want to take all images and properties of food by API)
 - I used a Firebase for Auth with phoneNumber, create users, create and pass orders (of food) to Firestore
 - The app has: OnBoarding screen that is shown only the first time the application is launched; 3 main screens (UITabBarController): HomeVC, BasketVC, AccountVC; And other View Controllers (DishDetail, ListDishes)
 - This app has UICollectionViews and UITableViews (all delegates and daraSource was connected inside Main.storyboard)
